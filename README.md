# Design (UI)

### Building a User-Friendly E-commerce Platform

While designing the e-commerce platform, a core focus was placed on creating a user-friendly experience through clear organization and information. All resources on the site are easy to find because everything is well-organized and presented clearly. User will be able to navigate the layout of the site intuitively, moving seamlessly from browsing categories to product pages and checkout. We also focused of prioritization of information. With semantic markup, I could highlight the crucial details for each product. Information is presented and categorized in terms of its priority. This means product descriptions and prices are front and center, while additional details like reviews are easily accessible but don't clutter the main view.

### User Control

The user should always get a positive emotional response when interacting with the website. To make this happen the website has a clear layout, easy and unambiguous navigation structures and all interaction feedback, using colours and confirmation messages. Other things that we keept in mind are:

- The user is shown progress indicators and feedback on transactions.

- Errors resulting from user or data actions are reported to the user.

### Consistency
One of the most important things we put time on was to have a consistency of design through all of the websites pages/sections. We been doing this by colours, fonts and layout.

### Accessibility
- High-Contrast Design: We employed color combinations with sufficient contrast between text and background for better readability.
- We designed a clean and consistent layout with predictable placement of elements, making the website intuitive to navigate

### Main Colours
![Color scheme](/documentation/colour-palette.png)
Color scheme was made at [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

We thought about what kind of mood we wanted to create for the website. Purple and pink together is a good balance. Purple can lean luxurious and sophisticated, while pink adds a touch of playfulness and energy.

We used black and white to create good contrast , they also help make the purple and pink pop even more."

### Fonts
The Bombastic Baths website are using the default fonts due to its cleanness and readability.

### Images
The images that are displaying on Bombastic Baths where generated on [leonardo.io](https://leonardo.ai/). I used an image that the ai generator could have as guidance, which gave me consistent product images. The hero images in the header on the home page are taken from [freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com/)
