               <p class="p-3">Our story began with a simple observation: many commercially available bath bombs were packed with harsh chemicals, artificial ingredients, and tested on animals. We knew there had to be a better way to experience the joy of a bath bomb without compromising your health or values.
                This realization fueled our passion to create bath bombs that were not only effective but also ethically sourced and handcrafted with love.</p>

               <h4 class="px-3">Vision</h3>
               <p class="p-3">We see a world where self-care and sustainability go hand-in-hand. Our mission is to craft luxurious bath bombs with simple, vegan-friendly ingredients that are never tested on animals. We use recyclable packaging and source ingredients responsibly, because bathtime shouldn't cost the Earth.</p>
